(?) NOTE: The expected matrices are sparse matrices therefore, search if any library is compatible with multiplying those matrices in an efficient way.

1. Libraries Tested:
    * Vanilla JavaScript: Basic, hand-implemented matrix multiplication algorithm.
    * Math.js: A powerful math library with support for matrix operations, including multiplication.
    * Numeric.js: A library focused on numerical computing, offering efficient matrix operations.
    * TensorFlow.js: A machine learning library that also provides matrix operations, optimized for use with WebGL acceleration.
    * Matrix.js: A lightweight library designed for matrix manipulation and linear algebra operations.







MATRIX.JS

Efficiency in Matrix Operations:
* Matrix.js is specifically designed for working with matrices and is highly optimized for common matrix operations like addition, multiplication, and transposition. Since it's focused purely on matrices, it likely implements its algorithms in a way that reduces overhead.
* Other libraries like Vanilla JS and Math.js are general-purpose math libraries and may not be as optimized for large-scale matrix operations, leading to higher execution times.


Vectorization and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data):
* Matrix.js may use optimized internal loops or vectorized operations that take advantage of JavaScriptâ€™s native optimizations for handling arrays efficiently, thus reducing computation time for large matrices.
* Libraries like TensorFlow.js are more generalized for deep learning tasks, and their operations are optimized for GPU/CPU parallelism but might not be as optimized for the specific task of matrix manipulation on the CPU.

Type of Operations:
* The benchmark suggests you are testing matrix operations, which Matrix.js is most likely optimized for. Other libraries like TensorFlow.js are designed for machine learning tasks and may have optimizations for tensor operations, which include matrix operations but also introduce additional complexities when not used for their intended purpose.

* Larger libraries like TensorFlow.js and Math.js may have more complex memory management mechanisms that, although beneficial for larger tasks like model training, can introduce inefficiencies in simpler tasks like matrix operations.


!!!! This is not classical matrix multiplication. This simply multiplies together each element in matrix A with the corresponding element in matrix B. If A and B are not the same size, it will produce some NaN results


A.mul(B); // returns [[3, 8, 15], [24, 35, 48], [56, 80, 99]]
